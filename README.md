# Simple REST API - Node.js (MVC Architecture)

## Project Overview

This project is a **simple REST API** built with **vanilla Node.js** following the **MVC architecture**. The API is designed to manage employee data with all the basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The data is in **JSON** format, and the application follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** structure.

### Features:
- **GET**: Fetch employee data
- **POST**: Add a new employee
- **PUT**: Update employee information
- **DELETE**: Remove an employee

The API is designed to work seamlessly with tools like **Postman** or similar REST API testing platforms.
